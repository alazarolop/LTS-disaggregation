# LTS-disaggregation
Modified code from the DSMART algorithm (Odgers et al., 2014) to incorporate the caret package specifically designed to help disaggregate the South African Land Type Survey (LTS) into a soil map.

Allows for any classification algorithm specified in the caret package, data pre-processing, and optimising parameters.
